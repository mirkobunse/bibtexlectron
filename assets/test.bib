In the relaxed setting, the decision threshold is simply changed so that the percentage of predictions matches the known class proportions; this change proves highly effective in the experiments. Comparison between Maximum Entropy, SVM, and Naive Bayes in all of these settings is provided. The learning task considered is named-entity-recognition (NER).},
